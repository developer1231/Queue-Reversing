# Queue Reversal Using a Single Queue in JavaScript
This simple yet elegant JavaScript implementation demonstrates how to reverse a queue using a single additional queue. Instead of relying on arrays or stacks, this solution uses basic queue operations (enqueue and dequeue) to reverse the order of elements.

- Key Features:
Queue Operations: Implements custom enqueue and dequeue methods to simulate queue behavior.
Efficient Approach: Reverses a queue by repeatedly dequeuing elements and appending them to an auxiliary queue, preserving queue properties.
No External Data Structures: Uses only the input queues for the entire operation, avoiding stacks or arrays for reversal.
